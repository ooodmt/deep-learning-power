# Deep Learning Power
In this repository I publish my various deep learning models.

Currently it contains only notebook where I train simple bidirectional LSTM network for sentiment analysis on [Amazon reviews dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html)
which contains positive and negative reviews from 5 different product categories, 2000 reviews each.
The task is fairly simple and model achieves test accuracy of 0.99 already after 5 epochs of training.
