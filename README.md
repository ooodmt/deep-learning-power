# Deep Learning Power
In this repository I publish my various deep learning models.

Currently it contains only notebook where I train simple bidirectional LSTM network for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow.
Dataset used: [Amazon reviews dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html). It contains positive and negative reviews from 5 different product categories, 2000 reviews each.

The task is fairly simple and model achieves test accuracy of 0.97 already after 5 epochs of training.
